*****************************************************************
*************************   PROJECT 2   *************************
*****************************************************************

The directory structure is as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
./imply.py  - The source code for the project. All of the coding you need
	         to do for this project will be done in this file.

./bench     - ISCAS circuits, implication commands, and correct example
	      program outputs.

./logs      - Logs created during execution are placed here by default.
	      The imply.py as provided automatically creates a log file
	      when run.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should be able to execute the program immediately. Launch the 765
virtual environment (see project description) and execute the program:
       
(765py) prompt> python imply.py bench/c17.bench bench/c17.impl temp

Note that the program will create one output file, "temp.result". The
location (and name) of this file is controlled by the last argument
provided when invoking the program.

To complete this project you will need to complete the "imply_and_check",
"report_j_frontier", and "report_d_frontier" functions. For extra credit
you can implement the "x_path_check" function and add unique D-drive
functionality to "imply_and_check". Assuming you use the program as its
given, creating the appropriate output files and writing out the circuit
state in the proper format is handled for you. However, you will need to
create the properly-formatted output for reporting the J and D frontiers,
as well as the X-path check should you choose to implement it. Examples of
correct outputs are given in the files in the bench/results/ subdirectory
and can be used to check the correctness of your program.

Documentation for the cframe module can be found in one of three locations:

	1. html generated from the cframe source code, found at:
	   http://ece.cmu.edu/~ee765/cframe_doc
	2. Comments located in the cframe source code, found at:
	   /afs/ece/class/ee765/project/cframe/cframe/cframe.py
	3. Invoking the help() function in an interactive python shell:
	   (765py) prompt> python
	   >>> import cframe
	   >>> help(cframe.Circuit)
